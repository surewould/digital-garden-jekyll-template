[The Gervais Principle](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/the-gervais-principle/)

I had a conversation with an autistic friend who was having a hard time understanding how allistic people communicate, and I was reminded of this series. It digs into corporate culture, power dynamics, communication strategies, and so on. In particular I felt the understanding of the communication strategies, namely PostureTalk, and PowerTalk would help him understand why some of his communication was failing, in addition to helping him understand where he fit in the hierarchy.

This definitely would be worth a re-read and more in depth notes.
