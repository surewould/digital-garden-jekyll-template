## Tools

- [Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/) - This is the editor I'm using as of 20220524 for most of my note taking and writing. It has a good mix of power features for zettelkasten systems, but it actually has a clean interface for writing that makes me want to actually write instead of muck around in a tool, or be distracted by an overly bloated code editor.
- [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) - A reference manager. A must have to help a system work.
